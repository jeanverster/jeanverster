## Hi! My name is Jean Verster 👋

#### I'm a Full Stack Software developer from Johannesburg, South Africa.
#### I'm passionate about all things tech, although I have been specializing in React & React Native over the last few years. When not writing code, you can find me hacking my way around a golf course 🏌🏼
